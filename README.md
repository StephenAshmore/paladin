Emulating an arbitrary custom-designed imaginary computer system.

Paladin is an arbitrary, imaginary computer system that should be reminiscent of systems long gone. See the paladin design documentation to learn more on the design of the system.
This repository contains the emulator for the paladin computer system ( and all design documents relating to paladin ). This is just a fun, simple emulator that I will be expanding on. It could be used in a game, or just to play around with. Paladin is built using Lua.

The Paladin-emulator uses simple interpretation to run code. In the future, this would be dynamic recompilation for speed. Paladin-emulator is currently designed for smaller programs, and as such loads an entire program into memory for execution.

Dependencies:
* Lua.
* [Classic Lua Classes](https://github.com/rxi/classic)
* [In the future, we will need a dependency for a graphics library]
