Emulating an arbitrary custom-designed imaginary computer system.

Paladin is an arbitrary, imaginary computer system that should be reminiscent of systems long gone. See the paladin design documentation to learn more on the design of the system.
This repository contains the emulator for the paladin computer system ( and all design documents relating to paladin ). This is just a fun, simple emulator that I will be expanding on. It could be used in a game, or just to play around with.


Dependencies:
None.
[In the future, we will need a dependency for a graphics library]
